# TRAN-F501-Internship-201819

Diseases like Alzheimer and Parkinson disease are the result of proteins aggregating into large 
fractal structures that hinder the cell function or even destroy them. Understanding how aggregates 
are formed and change over time is important to understand when they become harmful and how maybe 
treatments affect aggregate formation.

The goal of this Internship is to implement a simulation system to study aggregation between proteins. 
This work is performed in collaboration with the Switch lab in the KU Leuven, who has an extensive 
expertise in studying aggregation and related diseases.
