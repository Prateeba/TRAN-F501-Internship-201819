\section{Introduction}
Diseases like Alzheimer and Parkinson disease are the result of proteins aggregating into large fractal structures that hinder the cell function or even destroy them. Understanding how aggregates are formed and change over time is important to understand when they become harmful and how maybe treatments affect aggregate formation. \\

The goal of this Internship is to implement a simulation system to study aggregation between proteins and is performed in collaboration with the Switch lab in the KU Leuven, who has an extensive expertise in studying aggregation and related diseases.

\subsection{Mathematical modeling}
The principle task is to develop a method for simulating the time evolution of the $N$ quantities $\{X_{i}\}$, knowing only their initial values $\{X_{i}^{(0)}\}$, the form of the $M$ reactions $\{R_{\mu}\}$ and the values of the reaction parameters $\{c_{\mu}\}$.
There are two fundamental approaches to the mathematical modelling of chemical reactions.
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Deterministic models which are based on differential equations.
  \item Stochastic simulations where the fundamental principle is that molecular reactions are essentially random processes, i.e it is impossible to say with complete certainty the time at which the next reaction will occur. This approach uses basic Newtonian physics and thermodynamics to arrive at a form defined as the propensity function that gives the probability $a_\mu$ of reaction $\mu$ occurring in the time interval ($t, t+\delta t$).
\end{enumerate}

\section{Gillespie's stochastic framework of chemical kinetics}
\begin{defn}{Problem definition:}
We are given a volume $V$ containing molecules of $N$ chemically active species $S_{i}(i = 1, \dots, N)$. Let $X_{i} \equiv$ current number of molecules of chemical species $S_{i} \in V, (i = 1, 2, \dots, N)$ and let $R_{\mu} (\mu = 1, \dots, M)$ be the chemical reactions in which the species $S_{i}$ can participate. Each reaction $R_{\mu}$ is characterized by a numerical reaction parameter $c_{\mu}$. The goal is to simulate the trajectories of the $N$ chemically active species $S_i$ and predict which reaction will occur at each time step according to the correct probability distribution.
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}{}
The reaction parameter $c_{\mu}$ is defined so that $c_{\mu} \delta t$ gives the probability that a randomly chosen molecule of chemical species $S$ reacts during the time interval [$t, t+ \delta t$] where $t$ is time and $\delta t$ is an infinitesimally small time step.
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}{}
The probability that exactly one reaction $\mu$ occurs during the infinitesimal time interval [$t, t+ \delta t$] is equal to $S(t)k \delta t$ where $S(t)$ is the number of chemical species $S$ at time $t$.
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}{}
State of the system is defined by the number of molecules of each species and changes discretely whenever one of the reactions is executed.
\end{defn}

\subsection{Gillespie's Direct Method}
Given the problem defined above, the Gillespie's Direct Method answers two questions :
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Which reaction occurs next ?
  \item When does it occur ?
\end{enumerate}

  \subsubsection{Gillespie's Direct Method formulas}
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Probability density $P(\mu, \tau)$ that the next reaction is $\mu$ and that it occurs at time $\tau$ is given by : \\ $P(\mu, \tau)d\tau = a_{\mu}exp(-\tau \sum_{j}a_{j})d\tau$. \label{itm:(eq 1)}
    \item Probability that the next reaction is reaction $\mu$ is given by : \\  $Pr(Reaction = \mu) = a_{\mu} / \sum_{j}a_{j}$. \label{itm:(eq 2)}
    \item Probability distribution for times \\  $P(\tau)d\tau = (\sum_{j}a_{j})exp(-\tau \sum_{j}a_{j})d\tau$.\label{itm:(eq 3)}
  \end{enumerate}

\end{gather}
where the reaction parameters $c_{i} \in (i = 1, 2, \dots, 6)$ is equal to [1,1,2,1,2,1] respectively and the initial number of each species is $= 10$.

\subsection{Gillespie's Next Reaction Method}
The goal of the next reaction method is to do away with the above processes and update only the data that has been modified. The main idea is to generate a putative time $\tau_i$ for each reaction $i$ that will occur and choose the reaction $\mu$ whose putative time $\tau_{\mu}$ is least. In order to minimize the computation time, the Next Reaction Method is implemented using specific data structures.
To make the sampling of reactions more efficient, an indexed priority queue is used to store the reaction times. On the other hand, to make the recomputation of propensities more efficient, a dependency graph is used. This dependency graph tells which reaction propensities to update after a particular reaction has fired.

\section {Molecular mechanisms of protein aggregation}
Until now, all what was done is using random reaction parameters for each reaction in the stochastic simulation. However, in order to study the protein aggregation, understanding the kinetics of the aggregation is fundamental. In the following paper \cite{meisl_molecular_2016}, a protocol is described on how to make full use of kinetic descriptions derived from a model of the underlying microscopic reactions that make up the aggregation network. The fitted parameters are therefore meaningful and correspond to physical properties of the system, such as nucleus sizes, the kinetic rate constants of individual reactions and saturation concentrations.

The key idea is to analyze a large data set of multiple kinetic traces at different reagent concentrations simultaneously,with a single rate law and yield strong mechanistic constraints that will be helpful in choosing the appropriate models.

\subsection{Obtaining qualitative constraints : Half times}
\begin{defn}{} Half-time is defined as the time at which the signal has reached half of its final plateau value. \end{defn}

Given a dataset, several fundamental models can be considered for the fitting process to yield the rate constants. In order to choose the best model, adding some constraints based on the concentration dependence of the aggregation reaction is a solution. By considering how the half times scale with monomer concentration and how this scaling
depends on the monomer concentration, one can obtain constraints on possible mechanisms.

\subsubsection{Extracting half times}
\begin{algorithm}[!h]                     % enter the algorithm environment
\caption{Extracting half times algorithm}       % give the algorithm a caption
\begin{algorithmic}                       % enter the algorithmic environment
\REQUIRE Normalised data of aggregate concentration in units of fluorescence.
\REQUIRE Monomer concentration for each curve.
\ENSURE Scaling exponent.
\FOR{each curve}
    \STATE 1. Select the middle part of the curve.
    \STATE 2. Fit a middle line through the selected middle part.
    \STATE 3. Compute the point at which the fitted line crosses the value $0.5$
\ENDFOR
\end{algorithmic}
\label{alg:Gillespie's Direct Method}
\end{algorithm}

The slope of Log(half time) versus Log(monomer concentration) also known as the scaling exponent gives insight about the dominant process of fibre multiplication. This can in turn can be used to decide on possible models for the fitting.

Very generally :
\begin{enumerate}
\item A negative curvature in the double logarithmic plot (i.e., when the slope becomes steeper at higher
monomer concentrations and therefore the process is more monomer dependent) is indicative of competition between several
processes in parallel.
\item A positive curvature, in contrast (i.e., a flattening of the curve at higher monomer concentrations and thus
a decrease in monomer dependence), suggests the presence of a saturation effect in a serial process  or, in rare cases, at monomer concentrations close to solubility, it can be due to a change in nucleus size.
\end{enumerate}
The behavior of half-times with varying monomer concentration is, therefore, a good first guide to narrowing down the number of possible models. It limits the number of acceptable reaction networks by determining the reaction order of the dominant process and probing for competition or saturation effects. The model for fitting needs to be chosen to reflect these findings. \\
A flowchart to help decide on probable models using scaling exponents is shown section \ref{half-times}.

\subsection{From Half-times to models}\label{half-times} \cite{meisl_molecular_2016}
\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{Images/half_times_to_models.png}
\caption{The curvature of the double logarithmic plots and the value of their slopes gives insights into which aggregation mechanisms are dominant. The flowchart illustrates the decision process to arrive at a likely model, based on the half time plots.}
\label{fig: sample trajectory}.
\end{figure}

\subsection{Global fitting}\label{global_fit}
The Global fitting approach allows fitting large data sets, under a variety of conditions, usually a number of monomer concentrations, simultaneously to a single rate law. This enforces a relationship between experimental curves in which the free fitting parameters, such as rate constants and reaction orders, must be equal for all curves.
It ensures that the microscopic model has the correct dependency not only on time, but also on the other parameters that are varied, such as
the monomer concentration. Only in this manner can we obtain sufficient constraints to distinguish between the various complex models describing different aggregation reaction networks.

The fitting process minimizes the mean squared residual error
(MRE), given by   \[\frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=0}^N{(y_i - f(t_i))^2} \]
where $N$ is the number of data points, $y_i$ is the measured value
at time point $t_i$ and $f(t_i)$  is the model function evaluated at that
time point.

Mathematically, this represents a search for the global minimum on an $n$-dimensional energy landscape, where $n$ is the number of free fitting parameters.

\section{Results}\label{res}
\subsection{Amylofit's estimated rate constants in Gillespie's stochastic framework}
Given the following dataset :
  \begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{Images/normal.pdf}
  \caption{The x-axis denotes the time step and the y-axis denotes the fluorescence intensity of each experiment.}
  \label{fig: sample trajectory}
  \end{figure}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item The data is first normalised using the following formula  :
  \[ y_{norm,i} = (1 - M_{0,frac}) \frac{y_{i} - y_{baseline}}{y_{plateau} - y_{baseline}} + M_{0,frac} \] where :
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item $y_i$ is the original value of the $ith$ data point.
    \item $y_{norm,i}$ is its normalized value.
    \item $y_{baseline}$ is the average value of the data at the baseline.
    \item $y_{plateau}$ is the average value of the data at the plateau.
    \item $M_{0,frac}$  is the relative initial concentration of aggregates.
  \end{enumerate}

    \begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{Images/normalised.pdf}
    \caption{The x-axis denotes the time step and the y-axis denotes the normalised fluorescence intensity of each experiment.}
    \label{fig: sample trajectory}
    \end{figure}

  \item Secondly, the half time of each curve is computed.

    \label{fig: sample trajectory}
    \end{figure}

  \item Thirdly, the model is chosen according to the scaling exponent and the flowchart in section \ref{half-times}.
  For the current dataset and according to the scaling exponent, the model that will fit the best is the Secondary nucleation.

  \item The fourth step involves global fitting the data as described in section \ref{global_fit}.

  The fitted paramaters are :
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item $k_{+}k_{n} = 4.28+11$ in $conc^{n_c} time^{-2}$
    \item $k_{+}k_{2} = 636$ in $conc^{n_{2}^-1} time^{-2}$
    \item $n_c = 2$
    \item $n_2 = 2$
  \end{enumerate}

  \item The last step consists of using the above fitted parameters in Gillespie's stochastic framework in order to observe the behaviour of each component of the model.

      M is the number of free monomers in the system. $M_{0} = 1000$
     }
    \label{fig: sample trajectory}
    \end{figure}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Implemented simulations's estimated rate constants in Gillespie's stochastic framework}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Firstly the curves are normalised and the half times are computed.

\section{Conclusion}
The goal of this work was to study aggregation dynamics and develop a stochastic simulation system for protein aggregation and to provide scripts for visualization and analysis of the results produced by the simulation. \\
\\
At the term of this internship, a minimal system that mimics what is known from experiments has been implemented, thus, finding ways to fit the known fluorescence's data and find the actual kinetic rates. Secondly a stochastic simulation system was implemented to study protein aggregation based on the Gillespie's next reaction method. Lastly the fitted kinetic rates are plugged into the stochastic simulation to observe the behavior of the simulator.
This work was done in hopes of providing a stepping stone for further research and project applications in that context.
